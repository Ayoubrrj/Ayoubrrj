## Hi there 👋 

I'm [Ayoub](https://github.com/Ayoubrrj), a web development Student based in Belgium.🇧🇪

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll try to build it.

I've learned a lot at school, but I'm constantly grinding to push my skills to the next level. **Pixel perfection** and clean code are my goals.

- **Frameworks:** PHP (Laravel), JavaScript (Vue.js), Tailwind CSS
- 
- **Favorite Tools:** VS Code, Figma, and Notion (where all my ideas start)
- 
I've built a solid foundation, and I'm now looking for an internship where I can apply my skills and continue grinding my craft.

**Fun Facts:**
  - I have two cats.
  - I don't like coffee, but I'd die for a good cup of tea !
  - **The Mask** is my favorite movie
  - Hobbies: Anime, Gym, and building things.
