## Hi there 👋 I'm Ayoub

**Web Development Student based in Belgium 🇧🇪** *I design and build whatever I can imagine.*

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll build it and ship it.  
I've learned a lot at school, but I'm constantly grinding to push my skills to the next level. **Pixel perfection** and clean code are my goals.
- **Frameworks:** PHP (Laravel), JavaScript (Vue.js), Tailwind CSS
- **Favorite Tools:** VS Code, Figma, and Notion (where all my ideas start)

I've built a solid foundation, and I'm now looking for an internship where I can apply my skills and continue grinding my craft.


### ⚡ Fun Facts
  • I have two cats.
  • I don't like coffee, but I'd die for a good cup of tea !
  • **The Mask** is my favorite movie
  • Hobbies: Anime, Gym, and building things.
